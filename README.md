## 1.Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple and interactive dashboard using Tableau that helps visualize and analyze sales performance across:
- **Time (Month-Year)**
- **Regions (Central, East, South, West)**
- **Product Categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)**

This dashboard enables business stakeholders to explore trends, identify top-performing areas, and derive actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## 3. Explanation of Charts

### ðŸ”¹ Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)
Displays how total sales have changed over the years (2014â€“2017), allowing stakeholders to observe growth patterns and seasonal spikes in revenue.

### ðŸ”¹ Sales by Region (Bar Chart)
Compares total sales across regions. This visualization highlights regional performance, helping to identify strong and weak markets geographically.

### ðŸ”¹ Sales by Category (Pie Chart)
Breaks down sales by product category to determine which product lines contribute the most to overall revenue.

Each chart is dynamically connected through a **Region filter**, enabling focused analysis.
